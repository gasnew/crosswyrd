    + blue for correct, red incorrect
    + flash color changes
    + optimize drawing the frames
    - ease in and out of animation
    - longer flash at end?
    - move worker script elsewhere
    - set global palette for each frame using
      https://github.com/CalderWhite/gif-msg/blob/master/gif_msg.py#L46-L69 as
      reference for encoding data
  - show when complete, can download on click and share on social media

    - https://npm.io/package/any-steganography
  - possibly, crosswyrd landing page where can upload replay GIF to play or
    build your own puzzle
    - use gifuct-js to parse out data
- App Check
- discord integration
  - save edit links to discord automatically
  - submit puzzles to personal channel automatically and "all puzzles"
    (possibly just visible to me) channel on publish
  - when puzzle played, somehow update discord that puzzle was played?
  - special discord channel for puzzles completed at least once and played at least 5 times?
  - channel for curated puzzles?
  - link to discord puzzles from app, both in explainer and in player
  - stop clue sidebar jittering
- use words and clues from older puzzles (pre-2010)
- pro version
  - limited publishes (just store in localstorage or localforage)
  - banner to alert users of the upcoming change
  - account creation using firebase
  - stripe for transaction
- import/export
  - pro only
  - grayed out for non-pro?
- add DO NOT USE?
- edit puzzles
  - on first publish, generates private key and plops in URL
  - when load page, if puzzle UUID in URL, load from firebase, otherwise load
    from cache
  - save edit link (includes private key in the puzzle object, not included in
    the player...? Need to think about how to make this completely private)
  - when open edit link, loads puzzle saved to firestore and keeps key around
    in URL param to authorize editing the puzzle
  - when click publish, indicates publishing changes, auto-fills title and
    author, etc.
  - maybe don't allow edits but just supply a "build link" in discord?


ingest files as dictionaries
sell custom dictionaries?

BEEG BOARD

- pro features
  - use stripe for payment?
  - download as XML variant
  - edit from play link
  - custom dictionary (including ingesting a file)
  - toggle symmetry
  - toggle enforce NYT rules
  - show counts of 3-letter words
  - load word bank

- possible future features
  - sort words by grid score (could just be sum of entropies of blank tiles if
    the word were to be placed)
  - heatmap for failures: count up contradictions per tile somehow?
  - auto-fill prioritizes word bank?
  - dictionary with more common words?
  - import/export
    - export
    - import
  - add to dictionary prompt?
  - look at survey monkey for inspiration on clue-writing
  - check words in the possible words list in the background to see if they can
    be validly placed (probably use a separate WFC worker for this)
  - eliminate duplicate words
  - advanced donations
    - input code to unlock feature (color themes)!
    - when code input, donation button says "Thank you!" and has stars
  - button to clear word bank in one click
  - optimization: don't reset puzzle during auto-fill (now that wave is a part of history)
  - add virtual keyboard to builder
  - region filler
    - new tab called "Refill"...?
    - select a region => tab gets populated with N possible solutions for that
      area
    - user clicks one option to fill that region that way
    - find some way to prevent duplicate solutions and determine when we've
      tried every possible solution
      - probably keep a map from puzzle state hashes to list of next words
        chosen. Never pick a word from the list that matches your puzzle state
        hash
