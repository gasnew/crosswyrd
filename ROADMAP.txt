+ 15x15
+ Place black tiles
+ Auto-symmetry
/ Automatic WFC (alphabet is tile set, dictionary is constraints)
  - weights are scrabble weights (except inverse I guess)--could also be frequency in valid word list
  + add all updated tiles to queue
  + process through whole queue, finding all words across and down to find letter set (maybe set entropy here, actually)
  + each loop, set component state only when function has collapsed, then proceed to next tile
  + backtracks
+ visualize entropy as faded highlights

+ search => "write a word" + enter & clear
+ Allow typing letters and selecting full words for across or down
+ As typing in a word, see yellow-highlighted tile on board--turns white when "enter"
+ Overwrite existing words
+ autofill never backtracks user-entered words--if it backtracks too many times
  or cannot proceed without backtracking past user-entered word, show error
  message, "Auto-fill could not complete. Try clearing or changing one of the
  words you entered"
+ => "calculating..." spinner
  + Some sort of indicator for when long operation is happening
  + Use comlink to make web workers nice? https://dev.to/nicolasrannou/web-workers-in-create-react-app-cra-without-unmounting-4865#attempt-4--comlink
  + when computing wave, disable entering a new word/dict search
  + "calculating..." indicator
+ Any time black changed, recalculate off all letters
+ interface for typing in theme words into a word bank you want to have on the
  board
  + see suggestions for where they can go on hover
  + click and drag the word onto a valid slot
  x hint for shift+click to pick down instead of across
  x letter count
+ maybe update recalculating algorithm to support placing black tiles better
+ Allow clue entry
+ Grid selector
  + list of legacy grids
  + can just use plain grid
  + added some frankly dope animations
+ guided filling
  + button for "best next word" instead of "place 1"
  + sort words by increasing difficulty. Maybe use Scrabble weights here?
  + when word entered, go to next best automatically
+ better editing
  + select individual tile
  + remove input field
  + debounced wave updates
    + API now accepts whole puzzle, rather than changes ("observations")
    + if calculation active, stage the next one--overwrite stage if one present
    + useWaveFunctionCollapse determines observations from puzzle diff
    + reinstate adding words to dictionary
    + mirror black tiles again
    + make sure selection is always updated, even when redoing
    + fix backtracking algorithm
    + fix removing black tiles where options seems to be empty
+ add words to dictionary when formed by changing black tiles
  + do binary search in dictionary to check all words
+ turn off solver
  + can place words and blocks rapidly when solver is off
  + when solver off, still filters on existing words
  + spinner on solver
  + possibly filter out grids that have too few words
  + automatically turns on after 70+ words?
  + notification for when solver is turned on
+ QoL
  + do not mark ?s red
  + optimization: sort dictionary by word size
  + control selections and stuff when changing tabs + clicking on the board
  + auto-enter word when leave selection + remove selection when entered word
    x remove filled-in tile when leave selection if it was red? (try not doing this and see what happens)
  + auto-fill search with highlighted letters (replacing spaces with ?s?)
  + height 100%, overflow-y: hidden, center on board
  x place 1 and auto-fill disabled when done + they auto-place any decided wave elements
  x focus on word input if type while a word is selected (same with backspace)
  x undo to before auto-fill
  + note for when red tile appears
  + show all letters allowed on a tile (when selected?)
  x convert things to underscore?
  + auto-fill by word?
  + traverse by tile--fill input box is removed
  + optimize word list
  + fix solver going a second time again at the end
  + redo
  + move controls to above the grid, and move grid stuff to "new"
  + display total words and blocks
  + fix word bank and clues
  x in-focus vs out-of-focus coloration
  x blue border and outline + higher z-index + different color than entropy
  + fill assist turned on and off on grid selection only--also, turning on
    suggestion when >= 70 words
  + hover color faded & hide when cursor is hidden
  + . to toggle
  + arrow key navigation
  + spacebar to advance one position
  + clearer location of cursor + feedback
