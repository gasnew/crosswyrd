Place black tiles
Auto-symmetry
Automatic WFC (alphabet is tile set, dictionary is constraints)
- weights are scrabble weights (except inverse I guess)--could also be frequency in valid word list
- add all updated tiles to queue
- process through whole queue, finding all words across and down to find letter set (maybe set entropy here, actually)
- each loop, set component state only when function has collapsed, then proceed to next tile
Visualize entropy as faded highlights


Variable size
Toggle symmetry
Toggle enforce NYT rules
Show counts of 3-letter words
Allow typing letters and selecting full words for across or down (sorted by increasing difficulty? Maybe use Scrabble weights here?)
Any time black changed, recalculate off all letters
Allow clue entry
