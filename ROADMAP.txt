+ 15x15
+ Place black tiles
+ Auto-symmetry
/ Automatic WFC (alphabet is tile set, dictionary is constraints)
  - weights are scrabble weights (except inverse I guess)--could also be frequency in valid word list
  + add all updated tiles to queue
  + process through whole queue, finding all words across and down to find letter set (maybe set entropy here, actually)
  + each loop, set component state only when function has collapsed, then proceed to next tile
  + backtracks
+ visualize entropy as faded highlights

+ search => "write a word" + enter & clear
+ Allow typing letters and selecting full words for across or down
+ As typing in a word, see yellow-highlighted tile on board--turns white when "enter"
+ Overwrite existing words
+ autofill never backtracks user-entered words--if it backtracks too many times
  or cannot proceed without backtracking past user-entered word, show error
  message, "Auto-fill could not complete. Try clearing or changing one of the
  words you entered"
+ => "calculating..." spinner
  + Some sort of indicator for when long operation is happening
  + Use comlink to make web workers nice? https://dev.to/nicolasrannou/web-workers-in-create-react-app-cra-without-unmounting-4865#attempt-4--comlink
  + when computing wave, disable entering a new word/dict search
  + "calculating..." indicator
+ Any time black changed, recalculate off all letters
- interface for typing in theme words into a word bank you want to have on the
  board
  - see suggestions for where they can go on hover
  - click and drag the word onto a valid slot
- sort words by increasing difficulty? Maybe use Scrabble weights here?
- maybe update recalculating algorithm to support placing black tiles better

- QoL
  + do not mark ?s red
  - height 100%, overflow-y: hidden, center on board
  - "click to select down/across" tooltip
  - blue border and outline + higher z-index + different color than entropy
  - indicate ?s can be used as wildcards for searches
  + auto-enter word when leave selection + remove selection when entered word
    - remove filled-in tile when leave selection if it was red? (try not doing this and see what happens)
  - auto-fill search with highlighted letters (replacing spaces with ?s?)
