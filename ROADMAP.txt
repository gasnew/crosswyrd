+ Place black tiles
+ Auto-symmetry
/ Automatic WFC (alphabet is tile set, dictionary is constraints)
  - weights are scrabble weights (except inverse I guess)--could also be frequency in valid word list
  + add all updated tiles to queue
  + process through whole queue, finding all words across and down to find letter set (maybe set entropy here, actually)
  + each loop, set component state only when function has collapsed, then proceed to next tile
  - backtracks
+ visualize entropy as faded highlights


"click to select down/across"
blue border and outline + higher z-index
Variable size
As typing in a word, see yellow-highlighted tile on board--turns white when "enter" => "calculating..." spinner
search => "write a word" + enter & clear
Some sort of indicator for when long operation is happening

- when computing wave, disable entering a new word/dict search
- "calculating..." indicator
Edit existing words...?
autofill never backtracks user-entered words--if it backtracks too many times or cannot proceed without backtracking past user-entered word, show error message, "Auto-fill could not complete. Try clearing or changing one of the words you entered"
Toggle symmetry
Toggle enforce NYT rules
Show counts of 3-letter words
Allow typing letters and selecting full words for across or down (sorted by increasing difficulty? Maybe use Scrabble weights here?)
Any time black changed, recalculate off all letters
Allow clue entry
